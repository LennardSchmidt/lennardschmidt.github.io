The aim here was to introduce psychophysiological correlates for loss aversion to improve behavioral predictability. In an endowment experiment, a loss versus gain framing was implemented for a virtue versus a vice product. In addition to the classical price elicitation, an area of indifference and individual price reactions were examined, while emotional arousal as skin conductance levels were continuously measured. Furthermore, various heterogeneity measures for emotions and product experience evaluations were applied directly after the purchasing decision or as a more general personality measure at the end of the study. Results show fundamental regularities of product and frame on the price or the size of indifference. Physiologically measured emotional arousal further supports the dependence of loss aversion. Vice products and a loss frame increase emotional arousal and the consumer purchase price indifference. Reported emotions, aggregated as personality factors, can partially explain the observed heterogeneity in purchase price levels and price indifferences.","tags":["\"Psychophysiology\"","\"Skin conductance\"","\"Emotional branding\"","\"Choice uncertainty\"","\"Inconsistency measures\""],"title":"Reservation price uncertainty: Loss, virtue, or emotional heterogeneity?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lennard Schmidt","Erik Maier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"31542361869cbe5af8ade18056d5a6ef","permalink":"https://lennardschmidt.github.io/publication/dblp-conficis-schmidt-m-20/","publishdate":"2021-11-14T23:57:36.118613Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-conficis-schmidt-m-20/","section":"publication","summary":"Advertisers have to pay publishers for viewable ads, irrespective of whether the users paid active attention. In this paper, we suggest that a granular analysis of users viewing patterns can help us to progress beyond mere viewability and toward actual differentiation of whether a user has paid attention to an ad or not. To this end, we use individual viewport trajectories, which measures the sequence of locations and times an object (e.g., an ad) is visible on the display of a device (desktop or mobile). To validate our model and benchmark it against the extant models, such as the viewability policy (50% threshold) model, we use data from an eye-tracking experiment. Findings confirm the improved model fit, highlight distinct viewing patterns in the data, and inform information processing on mobile phones. Consequently, implications are relevant to publishers, advertisers, and consumer researchers.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing Ad Attention through Clustering Viewport Trajectories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rico Bornschein","Lennard Schmidt","Erik Maier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"0caa4ade595ef7797af6559f92ad3955","permalink":"https://lennardschmidt.github.io/publication/doi-10-1177-0743915620902143/","publishdate":"2021-11-14T23:23:36.949664Z","relpermalink":"/publication/doi-10-1177-0743915620902143/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent regulation in the European Union (i.e., the General Data Protection Regulation) affects websites’ information privacy practices. This regulation addresses two dimensions: websites must (1) provide visible notice regarding private information they collect through cookies and (2) give consumers the choice to disagree to such tracking. Policy makers must understand their regulation’s degree of implementation, as well as its effect on consumers. The authors develop a typology of website cookie notices along the dimensions of notice visibility and choice. A field study shows that most websites only offer low notice visibility and limited choice over private information collection. In addition, four experimental studies in the EU and United States explore the effects of information privacy practices. They find that offering choice over whether or which data are collected increases consumer power, whereas visibility of the notice (vs. no notice) only affects risk perceptions. The authors establish the novel suggestion that perceived risk is mitigated if consumers have more choice over their data (indirectly through greater power). Power and risk influence consumers’ affect and purchase intent.

At the same time, websites must allow consumers to disagree to the tracking of their browsing behavior. Despite sellers' concern about the loss of consumer insights—as consumers might disagree to the collection of their browsing data—cookie notices might also have a surprising side-effect: Consumers might accept frequent price changes (from personalized or dynamic pricing) more readily, if they agree through a cookie notice that their behavior can be tracked. Specifically, two experimental studies show that consent to the tracking of browsing behavior increases consumers internal attribution of a price change, as consumers attribute the cause of the change (here: giving up data) to themselves. This increases price fairness perceptions and, in turn, purchase intent. As a result, for online sellers of goods or services the implementation of cookie notice should no longer be thought as a matter to be avoided, but rather a trade-off decision: Loss of a part of consumer insights versus higher acceptance of data-driven marketing mix decisions, such as frequent price changes.","tags":["\"attribution theory\"","\"cookies\"","\"dynamic pricing\"","\"GDPR\"","\"personalized pricing\""],"title":"The effect of privacy choice in cookie notices on consumers' perceived fairness of frequent price changes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lennard Schmidt","Florian Dost","Erik Maier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6f208feed5e7021ef18c0c2eb0f7457f","permalink":"https://lennardschmidt.github.io/publication/dblp-conficis-schmidt-dm-19/","publishdate":"2021-11-14T23:57:37.223398Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dblp-conficis-schmidt-dm-19/","section":"publication","summary":"Information Systems research continues to rely on survey participants from crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., Amazon MTurk). Satisficing behavior of these survey participants may reduce attention and threaten validity. To address this, the current research paradigm mandates excluding participants through filtering heuristics (e.g., time, instructional manipulation checks). Yet, both the selection of the filter and the filtering threshold are not standardized. This flexibility may lead to suboptimal filtering and potentially p-hacking, as researchers can pick the most successful filter. This research is the first to tests a comprehensive set of established and new filters against key metrics (validity, reliability, effect size, power). Additionally, we introduce a multivariate machine learning approach to identify inattentive participants. We find that while filtering heuristics require high filter levels (33% or 66% of participants), machine learning filters are often superior, especially at lower filter levels. Their black box character may also help prevent strategic filtering.","tags":null,"title":"Filtering Survey Responses from Crowdsourcing Platforms: Current Heuristics and Alternative Approaches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lennard Schmidt","Erik Maier"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"a343a4871a726f1845df41653db4c085","permalink":"https://lennardschmidt.github.io/publication/https-doi-org-10-1002-mar-21214/","publishdate":"2021-11-14T23:23:38.442144Z","relpermalink":"/publication/https-doi-org-10-1002-mar-21214/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Perceived product size is a key concern in online retail, particularly in fashion and grocery. The screen on which consumers view a product (e.g., desktop or mobile) might constitute a frame that biases size perception, on the basis of assimilation and contrast effects (pool and store theory). The rise of mobile commerce exacerbates this issue, as framing effects might be stronger versus desktop settings as screens are smaller. Further, as mobile phone's screen orientation varies situationally (vertical vs. horizontal), the perceived product size might vary, depending on the interaction of screen and product orientation. By introducing the framing ratio as a means to predict extent, dimensionality and symmetry of size biases, we generalize specific findings from extant research. Empirically, four experimental studies demonstrate that contextual frames (i.e., vertical vs. horizontal screens) and product orientation (e.g., jeans vs. shoes) interact to bias the size perception, in that sizes are overestimated on the dimension that approaches the frame (high framing ratio), compared with conditions where the frame is distant (low framing ratio). If product size is misperceived, willingness to pay might be affected (e.g., for groceries). Thus, size perceptions have a direct impact on managerially relevant variables.","tags":["\"framing effects\"","\"framing ratio\"","\"horizontal–vertical illusion (HVI)\"","\"mobile commerce\"","\"screen\"","\"screen orientation\"","\"size perception\""],"title":"The interaction effect of mobile phone screen and product orientation on perceived product size","type":"publication"}]
